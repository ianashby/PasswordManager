# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database.  Describe how to use your program.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Future Work

Currently, this project stores unhashed and insecure passwords in the cloud. In the future, it would be ideal to store these passwords in a safer manner.
This would especially be needed if this were to be used on the backend of a web app. However, for this scope of this project, I have decided to turn off the password hashing feature. If/when this code is adapted for backend use not related to a password manager, I can easily adapt this code to work in a safe manner.

Additionally, if I wanted to further expand upon the project, I could build a proper user interface to complete all of the tasks available in this project.
